# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

# what is != and where should you use it?
# put ! before something, like !user_name
# put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# put ? before something
# put ? after something
# put !! before something, like !!user_name

# != is the not equal operator
# !user_name means opposite of its current boolean equivalent. In this case not user_name
# words.uniq! will return the words array with only unique elements
#? is the terinary operator
# !! will turn something to its boolean equivalent.
